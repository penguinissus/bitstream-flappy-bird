Tried out the all the editors on the bitstream website. Can't figure out why it originally works, and once I paste my code (which is essentially the same as the example on the website) it doesn't work. Also sometimes I make minor edits on the website, it would work, and sometimes it wouldn't. Can't figure out why, will ask on slack.
